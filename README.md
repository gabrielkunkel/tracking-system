# Technologies To Explore Together in TypeScript

Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL

### What I'm playing with
- [X] Async/Await for TypeScript
- [X] Connection Pooling PostgreSQL
- [X] Using mocked data created with [Mockaroo.com](https://www.mockaroo.com). I created a few datasets with foreign keys.
- [X] Use environmental variables using dotenv.
- [X] Express application with classes.
- [X] Dependency injection with InversifyJS. (For now I'm just using this with the database service, but more to come.)
